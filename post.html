        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this project for a few months at this point and I developed a real vision for a documentary
            style series that was going to entertainingly show my making of journey. After filming the first episode and
            a lot of reflection I&#39;ve decided that it might not be this best way to go about it. There are a number of
            reasons for this the first comes from my last FMP. A lot of things went wrong in the run-up to my FMP last year
            but by the end of it all I was convinced that I had delivered a Distinction level project. I even won an award
            for my work and was told my numerous teachers that it was exceptional. I was certain that the only grade I deserved
            and would receive was a Distinction. However when I got my grade back I was disappointed I received a Merit with
            no explanation of why and no hope of finding one as my marker had left the school. I spent some time thinking
            about why I didn&#39;t get a Distinction and I came to the conclusion that my evaluation and research must of
            been the culprits. </p>
          <p>The second part of this story comes when I came to watch back the footage of my first piece to camera in my vlog.
            Instead of seeing the well articulated and easy understanding evaluation I expected I saw a stuttering and convoluted
            mess. I managed to cut together a adequate evaluation but it was miles away from the slick video I&#39;d been
            envisioning for months. It was then that I realised that maybe my presentation skills weren&#39;t up to the level
            I thought they where and that my vision may, for now, be out of reach, at least without investing far too much
            time.</p>
          <p>Because of this I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;ll save my time editing for my final product and I&#39;ll keep my evaluation
            for the most part written. I might make a behind the scenes video if I have the time but my vision is so far
            from my ability that I fear that my ambition was what hurt my grade the last time and could hurt my grade again.
